# LAURA - PROJECT 1
## LTP - Laura's Trivia Pursuit

Create an API URL for Open Trivia DB using template literal & input from user for difficulty and category. Returns a question with 4 multiple choice answers. When user selects an answer, the pie is filled in if answered correctly, or ‘wrong’ is displayed. User has 10 chances to get all 6 pieces of pie filled in.

### MVP GOALS
- As a player, I want to click a difficulty level and category to get a question
- As a player, click my answer choice
- As a player, know if my answer is correct
- As a player, I want to know if I've won or lost

### Stretch Goals
- As a player, I would like to be able to pick my difficulty level and category for all 10 questions rather than individually 
- As a player, I would like to see the card flip back and forth from questions to answers
- As a player, I would like to see cool animations for winning and losing answers

### TOP NAVIGATION
