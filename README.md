# LAURA - PROJECT 1

## LTP - Laura's Trivia Pursuit - https://laurabobora.github.io/LTP/

Create an API URL for Open Trivia DB https://opentdb.com/ using template literal & input from user for difficulty and category. Returns a question with 4 multiple choice answers. When user selects an answer, the pie is filled in if answered correctly, or ‘wrong’ is displayed. User has 10 chances to get all 6 pieces of pie filled in.

### MVP GOALS

- As a player, I want to click a difficulty level and category to get a question
- As a player, click my answer choice
- As a player, know if my answer is correct
- As a player, I want to know if I've won or lost

### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like to be able to pick my difficulty level and category for all 10 questions rather than individually
- As a player, I would like to see the card flip back and forth from questions to answers
- As a player, I would like to see cool animations for winning and losing answers

### TOP NAVIGATION

- Info and Instructions Buttons
- Instruction Button - how to play the game -- _ended up putting instructions under title_
- Info Button - a little about me with my LinkedIn and why I’m doing this project

### TITLE BANNER

### DIFFICULTY LEVEL

- Drop down menu with easy, medium, and hard
- Will select level to put in API template literal

### CARD

- Will have category buttons to select category question
- Will “flip” to other side for question once difficulty and category selected

### PIE

- If question answered correctly, category colored pie piece will fill in
- If question not answered correctly, will remain empty

### WIN/LOSE

- Will have 10 questions to get all 6 pieces of pie

### NEXT STEPS

- Would have loved to get the pie added for effect
- I had pop-up alerts but found out late that those were not allowed. I was able to add a hidden div to pop up, but it doesn't look as great as I would like it to.
- More animations! CSS is tough
